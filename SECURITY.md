## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in our project, we appreciate your help in disclosing it responsibly.

We are partnered with Immunefi for handling security reports and coordinating our bug bounty program. Please submit any vulnerability reports through our official bug bounty page which can be found below.

This allows us to triage and respond to security issues efficiently, while also rewarding researchers for their contributions.

Thank you for helping keep our project and community safe!
